# Logo_Maker-SVG

## Introduction
This is the README for the SVG Logo Maker challenge of my coding bootcamp. This Repository contains a JS file for an application that generates a custom logo based on user input.

## Things Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn how to use javascript and node JS to use inquirer to gather information from a user, as well as to generate a .svg file based on that input. I also learned how to use jest to test my code to prove that it works as intended.

### Application Walkthrough

- After downloading the application files, you're going to need to install node js, inquirer, and jest.
    - to install node, follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and follow the directions
    - to install inquirer after you have node installed, type 'npm install --save inquirer' in your integrated terminal.
    - to install jest after you have node installed, type 'npm install --save-dev jest' in your integrated terminal.
- After the above steps are completed, you may start the test by navigating to the Logo_Maker-SVG/lib folder in your terminal, and tying in 'npm test'
- There will be a lot of text generated in the console going over how the classes used to construct the SVG file to ensure that they work.
- After the test ahs concluded, you may start the application by navigating to the Logo_Maker-SVG folder in your terminal, and tying in 'node index'
- there will be a series of prompts, answer them to generate a logo.
- after all prompts are filled in, a SVG file will be generated in the folder named "logos." feel free to open this file in your browser or in a photo editer to view your logo.
